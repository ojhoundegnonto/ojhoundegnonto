<!-- ## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ -->
I am a Ph.D. My background is physics, including ocean physics and climate dynamics, underpinned by a strong mathematics skillset with extensive experience using Python and Matlab for analysis. I extensively use Python Jupyter notebooks for my analyses of in-situ data, satellite data, and numerical model output (including ECCO) on both local and cloud (AWS-EC2 and Supercomputer) compute environments. My research interests expand from understanding the ocean responses to the climate change via air-sea interaction to the global freshwater cycle (Rivers, Sea Ice \& Precipitation). I am very flexible and eager to discover and learn new things to strengthen my career.
